YOU ARE PART OF A WINNING TEAM,
"""With an astonishing [number of locations] worldwide, it's the 16th time that SUBWAY® has claimed the top spot in",
"Entrepreneur's Franchise 500® -- and the franchise is as ambitious as ever."" ",
"Entrepreneur Magazine, announcing the 2008 Franchise of the Year ",
"Over its many years of successful operation, the Franchisor of SUBWAY® restaurants, Doctor's Associates Inc. (DAI), has",
developed a simple and supportive,system for its franchisees. Each SUBWAY® restaurant is independently owned and
"operated, including your restaurant. Our highly successful franchise system has earned us praise and respect in the Quick",
Service Restaurant (QSR) Industry. ,
HELPING SOCIETY ,
"The SUBWAY® restaurant system is a proud sponsor of the American Heart Association's Heart Walks, which occur annually",
"throughout the United States. The brand also sponsors the American Heart Association's “Jump Rope for Heart!” program,",
which promotes the value of physical activity to elementary school children. ,
"SUBWAY® franchisees are also active in their communities, sponsoring or taking part in activities to benefit such groups as",
"Habitat for Humanity, Special Olympics and many other local events. In","addition to being known for our community involvement,"
the SUBWAY® system has also become part of popular culture. You’ll see our logo at major sporting events throughout the,
world and we’ve been mentioned and featured in numerous television shows and movies ,
ABOUT THE COMPANY ,
"It was the summer of 1965 and 17 year-old Fred DeLuca was concerned about the future. To him, the thought of being able to",
afford a college education seemed as far-flung as the prospect of a man walking on the moon. ,
"On a fateful Sunday afternoon in July of that year, a business relationship was forged that would forever change the landscape",
"of the fast food industry. Hoping that family friend, Dr. Peter Buck, would have advice for him, young DeLuca explained how",
badly he wanted to study to become a medical doctor. ,
"""You should open a submarine sandwich shop,"" said Buck. ",
"What an odd thing to say to a seventeen-year old kid, thought Fred. Before he could respond or express surprise, however, Fred",
"heard himself ask, ""How does it work?"" ",
"To Pete Buck it was simple. Rent a store, build a counter, buy some food, open for business, and Fred would soon have enough",
"money to pay for college. If Fred was willing to do it, Pete would be his partner. He presented Fred with a check for $1,000--his",
investment in their new venture. ,
"Within a month, on August 28, 1965, the entrepreneurs opened their very first sandwich shop in Bridgeport, Connecticut. In",
"1974, the duo turned to franchising as a way to grow the business and by 2002, SUBWAY® restaurants surpassed McDonald's",
"as the largest restaurant chain, in terms of number of open and operating locations, in North America.",
TODAY A WORLDWIDE LEADER ,
"Today, with more than 29,500 locations in more than 85 countries, the SUBWAY® system is a leader in the QSR industry. We",
have earned an excellent reputation by offering healthy alternatives to traditionally fatty fast food.,
"Along with traditional SUBWAY® locations, we have more than 3,500 restaurants located in nontraditional places, like airports, ",
"colleges, and sports arenas. We also have several Regional Offices and Training Centers throughout the world.",

completed which courses and how well they did.,,If you have successfully completed and passed the courses by
"the time the monthly reports are run, you will be paid at the end of that month.",,"If not, you must retake them and will"
be paid at the end of the month in which you have completed them.,,You may take the courses as many times as
"you wish, many new hires do review them more than once to get everything down; however, you will only be paid",,
for one time. ,,
What if I don’t take them? Your Trainer will know right away if you have not completed them without having to,,
look at the reports.,New hires start on,probation; you will only successfully exit the probation period once you have
completed the required list of University of Subway courses shown in the last exhibit of the employee handbook.,,

WORK SHIFTS ,,,
Your work schedule,will be posted in advance of the work week – usually the Monday before the start of the week. ,,
You are expected to be on time for all your scheduled shifts and to,,be in full uniform before clocking in. At the end,
"of your shift, you are expected to clock out. It's important that you clock in and out at every shift to ensure your time",,,
is correctly recorded for each pay period. At no time should you have another employee clock in or out for you. ,,,
"To note, West Side Subs, LLC attempts to provide flexibility to work with our employees.",,," If however, it appears"
"you have excessive request offs, we may counsel you to opt out of working until your schedule frees up.",,,
"Once the schedule has been posted, you are responsible to work your shifts.",,,If you are not able to work your
"scheduled shifts, you are responsible for getting a co-worker to fill it for you. Please keep in mind the ‘Golden Rule’",,,
and be cooperative with swapping shifts if the need arises. Remember that you are part of a team and your actions,,,
affect others. All changes to the posted schedule must be approved by your manager. ,,,
MONEY OVER/SHORTS ,,,
It is very important that we provide our customers with the correct change back on each of their visits.,,,We do not
"want to over charge them nor under charge them – if we lose their trust on providing the proper pricing, they will",,,
stop coming!,"Importantly, it is DAI’s policy that the store must be within +/- $0.50 on their cash counts for the entire",,
week.,,,
You are personally responsible for any shortages that occur on your shift – or the entire day if you do not do a one,,,
minute cash in at the beginning and end of your shift.,,You may voluntarily repay the shortages to avoid any further,
discipline – which may include termination. ,,,
You are also personally responsible for all cash drops to the safe completed under your clerk ID number – do not,,,
let anyone use your clerk ID number.,"If a cash drop from your clerk ID is missing, or",,"short, you are personally"
responsible for the shortage. You may voluntarily repay the shortage to avoid any further discipline – which may,,,
include termination and criminal prosecution. ,,,
BREAD/PLATES/PIZZA SHORTAGES ,,,
We must accurately account for every Bread/Plate/Pizza used,,within the stores.,We have two reasons for keeping
track of the money and every Bread/Plate/Pizza used in the store.,,"First, DAI (Subway Corporate) tracks bread",
usage versus Sales and can fine Stores that appear to be under reporting sales compared to their,,,
Bread/Plate/Pizza usage. They do this because some stores have attempted to ‘steal’ from them by under reporting,,,
their sales and thus not paying the royalties due DAI.,,The second reason we track every Bread/Plate/Pizza used in,
"the store is employee theft. Unfortunately, we have had managers/employees that were ‘selling’ the sandwich and",,,
pocketing the money for it by not ringing it into the computer. This is stealing. We have camera’s in all stores and,,,
will prosecute any employee caught stealing.,,,
The Subway system provides for an accurate count in Cash required and bread/plate/pizza’s used during the day.,,,
The only reason for being short at the end of the day on bread/plate/pizza’s is employee error or theft. It is the,,,
requirement of every employee to make sure they are 100% accurate in ringing in sales and accounting for all,,,
bread/plate/pizza usage. All employees should notify management if they observe a fellow employee stealing from,,,
the company. ,,,
The employee may voluntarily repay any bread/plate/pizza shortage that occurs on their shift.,,,This voluntary
repayment of the shortage will replace harsher discipline which may include up to employment termination and,,,
criminal prosecution.,,The cost of shortage on bread/plate/pizza is the average retail value of the item. ,
"To be clear, we do not want to serve bad bread.",,"If it is hard, under cooked, over proofed, whatever – bread you",
"would not want to eat your self, please do not serve it.",,We have plastic containers in the back room of each store,
to place Bread/Pizza’s you do not want to serve.,,Please put bad bread in this container.,You must include these in
your bread counts at night.,,,
"To protect yourself, please conduct a One Minute Cash in at the beginning and end of each of your shifts.",,,If you
"are unsure how to conduct a One Minute Cash-In, please ask your manager for training. ",,,

Introduction ,,v 
Introduction ,,
SUBWAY welcomes,you as a part of their employee family. ,
You have now officially started on,,your path of training to become a sandwich artist. From this
moment on you will be making sandwiches that put a smile on your customer’s faces. From now,,
"on, you represent SUBWAY as an employee and you also represent the many celebrity faces on",,
"our commercials such as: Jared, Michael Phelps and Michael Strahan. ",,
When you first begin,"your training,",your trainer will begin with the Sub-way of how to perform
all the different tasks. The Sub-way is our company’s procedures on how to do every task. Your,,
job is to make sure to always listen to what the customer says because the customer is always,,
right no matter what the issue. ,,
"Our belief is that as long as you have a good attitude and good work ethic, you will definitely be",,
"able to keep our customers happy, which is of course the most important part of your job.",,
"Remember, without customers we do not generate any revenue. Once again I will repeat the",,
"saying, “The customer is always right.”",,
Chapter 1: The Training Process 
Chapter 1 ,,3,
Chapter 1: The Training Process ,,,
The training process begins with a pre-test. You will be given one pre-test before all 5 of your,,,
training shifts. After you complete,"your pre-test,",you will be asked to fill out some paper work,
regarding,your taxes and a few papers from us that have to be signed by the trainee. After,,
completing the paper work process is when the “real deal” begins. This is where you finally,,,
"begin to put together different types of sandwiches for customers, although you will watch",,,
someone make the first few sandwiches in order for you to better understand the Sub-Way of,,,
how to make a sandwich. The whole training process will consist of a total of 5 days. Each day,,,
"you will learn new tasks, on the last day of training however, you will be completely on",,your,
own. You will be expected to recall and remember all procedures that,,you learned during,your
previous 4 days of training. At the end of every shift you will receive a post-test related to,,,
everything,you trained for that day. You are required to pass every post-test in order for,you to,
pass the validation at the end of,your training. During validation,you will be asked a few,
questions about the Sub-way process and finally if you proceed to answer these questions,,,
"correctly,",you will be awarded the job. ,,
Training: Day 1 ,,,
On Day 1 of training,you will begin by completing all necessary paperwork that is given to,you,
by the manager. Most of these papers are related to the company itself and there are also a few,,,
papers related to filing,your taxes and the last paper in there is for direct deposit which is,,
"optional to fill out. If you do decide to go through with direct deposit, you will have to submit",,,
the form to your bank,"yourself. After completing all necessary paperwork, you will finally",,
receive what,"you have been waiting for the whole time, your Subway uniform. You will initially",,
"be given 2 shirts, 1 apron and 1 hat. You will have to purchase the pants yourself; they can be",,,
"either black or khaki. If you are to lose any of these pieces of uniform, they each cost $10 to",,,
replace so please take care of your uniform and keep it nice and clean. If you do happen to come,,,
"to work with a dirty uniform, you will be forced to buy whatever piece of uniform is dirty, and",,,
"the cost will be deducted out of your check automatically. Then,",,you will get a quick tour of the,
"whole store and will be shown where everything belongs. For example, you must know what",,,
products belong in the walk-in and which ones belong in the freezer.,,You must also know where,
"other things in the store are such as: frozen bread, frozen cookies, frozen meats and frozen soups.",,,
After getting familiar with the walk-in and freezer you will head to the front to observe,,your,
trainer help customers with their requests. You will observe,,your trainer for one hour and this,
will be the end of,your first day of training. ,,
Training: Day 2 ,,,
On Day 2 of training,you will first begin by having the manager insert,your information into the,
store computer so that,you can be assigned a password to clock-in and clock-out. Once you’re,,
4,,Subway Employee Training Manual ,
"done with this process,",you will clock-in for the first time. Your first day of training hours will,,
then manually be put into the system so that,you are paid for it.,,
"After completing this process,",you will come to the back of the store where you will be taught,,
how to cut all the different vegetables that need to be cut. The vegetables that need to be cut by,,,
"employees are: tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and bell peppers. When first learning how to cut",,,
"these vegetables, it can be very tedious, time consuming, and the machines can be a little",,,
intimidating. The reason that the machines can be intimidating is because the blades on these,,,
machines are extremely sharp and,you can easily tell just by looking at them.,"However, if",you
cut the vegetables as,"you are told, you should be fine and shouldn’t have to worry about cutting",,
yourself with the blades. Once,you have finished cutting all the vegetables given to,"you,",you will
learn how to prepare the vegetables that already come cut-up. All that has to be done with these,,,
is: you take a cambro (which is a black container which is used for storing pretty much,,,
"everything in the store), put a filter at the bottom (so that the vegetables don’t sit in their own",,,
juice) and finally pour the bag of vegetables into the container making sure that you try to drain,,,
away as much of the juice from the vegetable bags as possible. After,,you are done putting all the,
"vegetables in their containers,",you must label each and every container. On the label,you will,
"write your name, the date you opened the item and the date",,you can keep the item till. You will,
then take all the containers and place them in the walk-in until they are ready to be used.,,,
"After completing this process,",you will move on to the front of the restaurant where,you will be,
taught how to re-stock the whole line. This is a very important procedure due to the fact that if,,,
"the line is not restocked correctly,",you will constantly be running to the back to go get vegetables,,
or meats whenever you run out. So you must make sure that everything is filled to the top. After,,,
"this, you must check the fridge behind the line and make sure there is at least 2 extra containers",,,
of every single vegetable and meat. This will keep you from running back and forth from the,,,
front to the back constantly. After making sure that you have enough of everything to the front,,,
you will finally begin helping customers for the first time. You will be observed by the manager,,,
to make sure,you are following all rules and are using the Sub-way method to put together the,,
customer’s sandwiches. You will do this for about an hour or until your manager thinks you’ve,,,
"got the main concepts down. After this,",you will have completed,your second day of training and,
will be 3 training days away from completing,your training. ,,
Training: Day 3 ,,,
On Day 3 of your training,you will come in and first begin by learning how to make bread.,,It
"begins with laying the frozen bread out onto metal pans the night before. This way, by the time",,,
"you come in the next morning, the bread will be defrosted and will be ready to be marked.",,,
“Marking” the bread is when you take a blade and cut small lines into the bread which gives it,,,
the lines that you see on top of every piece of our bread. The marks also help keep the bread,,,
from exploding while baking because it acts as a hole to let out any extra air that was left in the,,,
"dough. After “marking” the bread it is ready to be put into the proofer. However, before getting",,,
Chapter 1 ,,5
"too far ahead,",you must make sure that the bottom tray in the proofer is full of water in order to,
help inflate the bread better. After making sure that there’s water in the tray make sure that the,,
temperature of the proofer is set to 125⁰F. If the temperature is not set correctly the bread will,,
"not inflate enough and this will cause your bread to look foul. Once the proofer reaches 125⁰F, it",,
is time to move the bread from the back of the restaurant to inside the proofer. Each shelf can,,
hold up to 2 pans of bread which means,you can fit up to 12 pans inside at once. You will know,
the bread is ready once the bread on the very top shelf is almost touching the top of the proofer.,,
"This is when you know to take it out, however, you must be very careful when taking out the",,
"bread, because proofed bread will deflate if it is even slightly touched up against anything. After",,
taking the bread out of the proofer you will insert it into the oven which should’ve been pre-,,
heated to 325⁰F. ,,
"Once inserted into the oven, it will take about 10-15 minutes and should look golden brown",,
when ready. Once the bread is ready to be taken out of the oven,,you must first grab the bread
cart and the oven mitt considering the pans are extremely hot. Take the pans out of the oven one-,,
by-one and place them onto the cart. Once all the bread has been removed from the oven it needs,,
to cool down for atleast 15-20 minutes before it is moved into the bread cabinet. If you do not,,
"allow the bread to cool down, and instead put it straight into the bread cabinet, condensation will",,
"cause the bread to become soggy, and this will cause the bread to mold overnight and it will have",,
to be thrown out the next morning. ,,
"After learning the process of how to make bread, you will then go onto learn how to bake",,
cookies. This process is fairly simple. All,"you have to do is, first, preheat the oven at 300⁰F.",
While the oven is pre heating,you can put together your trays of cookies. This is done by first,
"taking a baking pan and placing a baking sheet inside of it. Then, you will take each individual",,
cookie and place it on the markers that are given on the baking sheet. There are 12 markers on,,
the sheet which means each tray can fit up 12 cookies. ,,
Once,"you are done placing the cookies on the pans, you will let them sit for about 10 minutes so",
"they can defrost. If you place frozen cookie dough straight into the oven, it will cause the cookies",,
to burn from the outside because they will take too long to defrost while cooking. After letting,,
"the cookies defrost, place them in the oven for 12 minutes or until golden brown. Once they are",,
"ready,",you will once again take them out and place them onto the bread cart in order to let them,
cool before,you place them inside the cookie rack. After learning the baking techniques,you will
move on to the front of the restaurant once again under manager supervision to make sure,,you
are starting to slowly grasp the Sub-way technique of putting together a sandwich. Once the,,
manager thinks,you have had enough training for the day,"you will be told so, and this will be the"
end of,your 3rd training shift. ,
Training: Day 4 ,,
On day 4 of your training you will first begin out front by helping customers by making their,,
sandwiches. This will be your first time being on,,your own without any supervision of a manager
6,,Subway Employee Training Manual ,
considering that by,your 4th training shift you should be pretty efficient at the Sub-way process.,,
You will stay in the front of the restaurant for the first 2 hours of your shift. Make sure to have,,,
any questions answered no later than this shift considering that,,your final shift will be an overall,
evaluation determining whether or not,,you get the job. The manager will tell you to come and let,
them know whenever you feel that,you are ready to take the front of the house evaluation test.,,
This basically means that you are done training in the front of the restaurant and consider,,,
yourself as ready to take on customers on,,your own. Once,you have finished in the front you will
be taken to the back where,your trainer will show you how to wash dishes with the 3-,,
"compartment method (Rinse, soak & sanitize). ",,,
"It’s a fairly simple process, which starts off by rinsing off any food residue left on the dishes.",,,
Once,"you are done rinsing the dishes with water,",you will put the dishes in the middle,
compartment which should be filled with soap water. This is where,,you will scrub the dishes,
with a sponge to get out any extra grease or residue that didn’t come off while rinsing the dishes.,,,
"Finally, once the soak part of the process is done, the final step is to fill the third compartment of",,,
the sink with sanitizer solution. Once the compartment is filled with sanitizer you will move the,,,
dishes from the soap to the sanitizer and leave them in there for at least 30 seconds. Once,,you,
"have finished sanitizing the dishes put them on the rack above the sink upside down, and let them",,,
dry. After,you have finished washing dishes,you will proceed to the last step of your 4th training,
"shift, which is, learning how to close the store. ",,,
"Closing the store is probably considered one of the most difficult tasks to learn, only because",,,
there are many small steps involved. The first step to closing the store is picking up the whole,,,
line in the front of the restaurant and moving it into the walk-in so that everything stays fresh,,,
overnight. Once,"you have finished picking up the line, the next step is to clean and wipe down",,
"the entire line. Then,",you must sweep and then mop the entire store; this is a very important step,,
in order to prevent pests from coming into the restaurant. After you are done sweeping and,,,

Chapter 3: Menu items ,,
Vegetables ,,
"As far as vegetables go, the easy way to remember which ones stay outside and which ones go in",,
"the walk-in is, by remembering that all veggies that come in a liquid a stay outside: this would be",,

"walk-in: this would be lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, bell peppers and spinach.",,
"Vegetables are cut first-thing at the beginning of every shift. So for example, if you were to open",,
the store for breakfast,you would cut fresh vegetables or if,"you came in to work the night shift, as"
"soon as you arrive,","you would first start off by cutting vegetables. The reason for this is because,",
we only cut enough veggies to last us one whole shift so that it stays fresh and crisp. If we were,,
